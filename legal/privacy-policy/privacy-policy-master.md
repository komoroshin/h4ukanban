## 7. AI Transparency

Given the critical importance of AI transparency in healthcare, this section provides detailed information about how we use artificial intelligence.

### 7.1 AI Systems We Use

#### 7.1.1 AI Health Assistant (for Patient Users)

**Purpose**: Answer health questions, track symptoms, provide health information

**Technology**:
- Large Language Models: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude
- Proprietary symptom analysis model (trained on de-identified data)

**How it works**:
1. You submit a question or symptom via text or voice
2. Your input is encrypted and sent to our servers
3. We apply de-identification (remove direct identifiers) before AI processing
4. AI generates a response based on general medical knowledge
5. Response is reviewed for safety (automated checks + human review for high-risk topics)
6. Result is returned to you with "AI-generated content" label

**Important Limitations**:
- ⚠️ AI may provide inaccurate or incomplete information
- ⚠️ AI does NOT replace medical advice from licensed providers
- ⚠️ AI cannot diagnose conditions or prescribe treatments
- ⚠️ Always consult a healthcare provider for medical decisions

#### 7.1.2 AI-Scribe (for Clinic Users)

**Purpose**: Transcribe and document patient-provider conversations

**Technology**:
- Speech recognition: AWS Transcribe Medical (HIPAA-compliant)
- Clinical note generation: Proprietary model + OpenAI (with BAA)

**How it works**:
1. Provider activates AI-Scribe during patient visit
2. Conversation is recorded (with patient consent)
3. Audio is transcribed to text using medical vocabulary
4. AI generates clinical note draft (SOAP format, ICD-10 codes)
5. **Provider reviews, edits, and approves** before note becomes part of medical record

**Critical requirement**: Healthcare providers MUST review and approve all AI-generated documentation. AI outputs are drafts, not final medical records.

#### 7.1.3 Symptom Analysis Engine

**Purpose**: Identify patterns in self-reported symptoms

**Technology**: Proprietary machine learning model

**How it works**:
- Analyzes symptom trends over time
- Suggests relevant health topics to discuss with provider
- Does NOT diagnose conditions

**Training data**: De-identified symptom logs from consenting users (HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification)

### 7.2 AI Training Data Practices

#### 7.2.1 Third-Party AI Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)

**Under our Business Associate Agreements**:
- ✅ Your data is NOT used to train their general models
- ✅ Prompts and responses are NOT retained beyond API call completion
- ✅ Zero-retention policy for Protected Health Information
- ✅ Servers hosted in HIPAA-compliant environments

#### 7.2.2 Healthy4U Custom Models

**For Patient Users who opt in ("Use my data for AI improvement")**:
- We may use **de-identified** data to train proprietary models
- De-identification method: HIPAA Safe Harbor (remove 18 identifiers) + expert determination
- **Opt-out anytime**: Settings → Privacy → Toggle off
- Opting out does NOT affect your ability to use AI features

**For Clinic Users**:
- Clinical documentation data is NOT used for AI training by default
- Clinics may opt in to contribute de-identified data via formal agreement
- Opt-in requires clinic administrator approval and patient consent

#### 7.2.3 De-Identification Standards

**We remove**:
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, Social Security numbers
- Medical record numbers, account numbers
- IP addresses, device identifiers
- Dates (replaced with year or age ranges)
- Facial images and biometric identifiers
- Any other unique identifying information

**Verification**: Annual expert determination review to confirm no re-identification risk

### 7.3 Human Oversight

**All critical AI outputs involve human review**:

| AI Feature | Human Oversight |
|------------|-----------------|
| **AI Assistant (health concerns)** | Automated safety checks; human review if high-risk keywords detected (suicide, abuse, emergency symptoms) |
| **AI-Scribe (clinical notes)** | **Mandatory**: Licensed healthcare provider must review and approve every note |
| **Symptom analysis** | Reviewed by clinical team if suggesting urgent care needed |
| **Telemedicine provider matching** | Human verification of provider credentials and licensing |

**You can always request human review**: Contact support@healthy4u.com

### 7.4 State-Specific AI Disclosures

#### 7.4.1 Texas (TRAIGA Compliance)

**NOTICE TO TEXAS RESIDENTS**:

Artificial intelligence is used in the following features:
- AI Health Assistant
