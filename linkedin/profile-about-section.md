## ✅ ВАРИАНТ 1: Сбалансированный (для клиник + инвесторов)

**Копируй и вставляй в LinkedIn About:**

```
Healthcare shouldn't end when the clinic closes.
At Healthy4U, we're making medical expertise accessible 24/7 through AI.

THE PROBLEM

Most patients wait days for appointments. Simple health questions go unanswered. Clinics lose potential patients due to limited availability.

In Europe alone, 68% of patient questions happen outside clinic hours. 40% never get answered. That's not just frustrating — it's a €50 billion opportunity cost.

OUR SOLUTION

Healthy4U is an AI-powered health assistant that:
✅ Provides instant, medically-accurate answers 24/7
✅ Triages patient concerns and books appointments automatically
✅ Integrates seamlessly with clinic workflows
✅ Reduces admin workload by 40%

TRACTION

• Live in App Store
• 10,000+ AI consultations delivered
• Partnership pilot with Gav Cure (spine & orthopedic clinic)
• Results: 30% increase in appointments, 40% reduction in admin calls
• 4.8/5 patient satisfaction score
• Growing 40% month-over-month

FOR CLINICS

Turn every patient question into a potential appointment. Your front desk focuses on in-person care. Patients get answers instantly. Everyone wins.

RAISING SEED

🚀 Currently raising €500K to:
• Scale clinic partnerships across Spain & EU
• Enhance AI medical accuracy & specialization
• Build insurance integrations
• Expand into new medical verticals

WHY THIS MATTERS

I grew up in Siberia. Healthcare access was limited. I studied telecom engineering, built businesses across Europe, launched projects with organizations like the International Chess Federation.

Every project taught me one thing: Technology should democratize access.

Healthcare is the ultimate access problem. And AI is the solution.

## ✅ ВАРИАНТ 2: Фокус на клиниках (если приоритет B2B)

```
Helping clinics scale without hiring more staff.

At Healthy4U, we built an AI assistant that handles patient questions 24/7 — so your team can focus on care, not calls.

THE CHALLENGE EVERY CLINIC FACES

Your phone rings at 6:30pm. A patient asks: "Is this rash serious? Should I come in?"

Your clinic is closed. The call goes to voicemail. The patient Googles it. They get scared. They go to ER. Or worse — they do nothing.

You just lost a patient. And they didn't get the care they needed.

This happens hundreds of times per month across every clinic in Europe.

OUR SOLUTION

Healthy4U is an AI health assistant that:
✅ Answers patient questions instantly (medically accurate)
✅ Triages urgency (knows when it's serious)
✅ Books appointments directly into your calendar
✅ Integrates with your existing systems (WhatsApp, web, EMR)

REAL RESULTS

Gav Cure Medical Center (spine & orthopedics):
• 30% more appointments booked
• 40% fewer "just checking" calls
• 4.8/5 patient satisfaction
• Setup time: 2 hours

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

We're not selling software. We're delivering:
• More patients (qualified appointments, not tire-kickers)
• Less admin work (AI handles repetitive questions)
• Better experience (patients get instant answers)

It's not about technology. It's about outcomes.

WHO I AM

Telecom engineer → Business development → Tech entrepreneur → Healthcare AI founder

I've built businesses across Europe, raised funding, launched projects with the International Chess Federation. Now I'm all-in on solving healthcare access.

Currently: Chief Strategy Officer @ Healthy4U
Currently: Raising €500K Seed to scale across EU

LET'S TALK IF

• You run a private clinic (any specialty)
• You're losing patients due to limited availability
• Your front desk is overwhelmed with repetitive questions
• You want to grow without massive hiring costs
