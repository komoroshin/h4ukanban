---

## 5.3 Recommended Approach

**Primary Recommendation:** **Implement Healthy4U** as your comprehensive AI platform.

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Pilot & Prove Value**
- **Goal:** Validate ROI with 1-2 physicians before full rollout
- **Scope:**
  - Pilot physicians: [Dr. A, Dr. B] (champions identified)
  - Use cases: AI scribe + patient app (prioritized features)
  - Timeline: 4-6 weeks setup + 8 weeks measurement
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Time savings: ≥ 3 hours/week per physician
  - Physician NPS: ≥ 8/10
  - Patient app adoption: ≥ 50% of pilot physician's patients
- **Decision Point:** If successful → proceed to Phase 2. If not → iterate or reconsider.

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Full Rollout**
- **Goal:** Expand to all physicians
- **Scope:**
  - All [X] physicians onboarded
  - All patients invited to app (email campaign, in-office signage)
  - Staff trained on new workflows
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Success Criteria:**
  - [X]% of physicians actively using AI scribe
  - [Y]% of patients enrolled in app

**Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Optimize & Expand**
- **Goal:** Maximize value, add advanced features
- **Scope:**
  - AI clinical consultant (preventive insights) fully adopted
  - Integrate deeper with EHR (if API available)
  - Measure long-term outcomes (no-show rate, patient satisfaction, ROI)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Net annual savings ≥ $[X],XXX
  - Payback achieved (< [Y] months)

### Alternative: "Scribe-Only" Approach (Not Recommended)

If you choose **Freed** (scribe-only), you'll save money upfront but miss patient engagement benefits:
- Year 1 cost: $[X],XXX (vs $[Y],YYY Healthy4U)
- Savings: $[Z],ZZZ/year
- **But:** No patient app → still have patient engagement problem
- **Long-term:** Need to add patient solution later → more complexity, higher total cost

**Verdict:** False economy. Spend [X]% more now for complete solution.

# 6. Implementation Roadmap

## 6.1 Phase-by-Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot (Months 1-3)

**Month 1:**
- Week 1-2: Contract signed, kickoff meeting, Healthy4U account setup
- Week 3-4: EHR integration (API or manual workflow), physician training (2 hours), pilot launch

**Month 2:**
- Pilots use Healthy4U daily (AI scribe for all visits)
- Patient app soft launch (pilot physicians' patients invited via email)
- Weekly check-ins with Healthy4U support

**Month 3:**
- Measure results: time saved, satisfaction, patient adoption
- Iterate based on feedback
- **Go/No-Go Decision:** Proceed to full rollout if success criteria met

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ 2 physicians actively using AI scribe
- ✅ [X] patients enrolled in app
- ✅ Pilot results report (time savings, NPS, feedback)

### Phase 2: Full Rollout (Months 4-6)

**Month 4:**
- All [X] physicians onboarded and trained
- Patient app full launch (email campaign, in-office signage, front desk scripts)
- Staff training (MAs, front desk on new workflows)

**Month 5:**
- Monitor adoption and usage
- Address issues and optimize workflows
- Collect feedback from physicians and patients

**Month 6:**
- Stabilize operations
- Celebrate early wins (present time savings data to team)
- Plan for Phase 3 (advanced features)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ 100% physician adoption
- ✅ [X]% patient app enrollment
- ✅ Documented workflows and training materials

### Phase 3: Optimize (Months 7-12)

**Month 7-9:**
- Enable AI clinical consultant (preventive insights)
- Deepen EHR integration (if API becomes available)
- Track long-term outcomes (no-show rate, patient satisfaction)

**Month 10-12:**
- Measure 1-year ROI (did we hit savings target?)
- Document case study (for marketing, internal use)
- Explore additional features (admin automation, etc.)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ AI consultant in use by physicians
- ✅ 1-year ROI report
- ✅ Case study / testimonial

## 6.3 Resource Requirements

### Budget

| Item | Cost | When |
|------|------|------|
| **Healthy4U Subscription** ([X] physicians) | $[Y],YYY/year | Monthly |
| **Implementation Support** (Tier 2, optional) | $[Z],ZZZ | 50% upfront, 50% at go-live |
| **Training Time** (physician + staff opportunity cost) | $[A],AAA | Month 1-2 |
| **Patient Onboarding Materials** (signage, emails, optional) | $[B],BBB | Month 4 |
| **TOTAL** | **$[C],CCC** (Year 1) | - |

### Time Commitment

**Physician Time:**
- Initial training: 2 hours per physician
- Pilot participation: [X] hours/week (shadowed by Healthy4U during pilot)
- Ongoing: Net time savings (not additional time)

**Staff Time:**
- Practice Manager: 5-10 hours (project coordination)
- Front Desk / MA: 2-3 hours training
- Ongoing: Minor workflow changes (mostly automated)

**External Support:**
- Healthy4U: Implementation support included (email + phone)
- Optional: Consultant support ($[X],XXX for Tier 2 implementation)

## 6.4 Risk Mitigation

### Risk #1: Physician Resistance

**Risk:** Some physicians may resist new technology, prefer status quo.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Pilot with champions first (demonstrate value before asking skeptics)
- ✅ Show data (time savings, satisfaction from pilot)
- ✅ Make adoption voluntary initially (peer pressure works better than mandates)
- ✅ Address concerns (accuracy, ease of use) with live demos and trial

**Contingency:** If a physician truly refuses, don't force. Focus on willing adopters first.

### Risk #2: Low Patient Adoption (App)

**Risk:** Patients don't download or use the app.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Multi-channel onboarding (email, SMS, in-office signage, physician recommendation)
- ✅ Incentivize (e.g., "$5 off copay if you sign up during visit")
- ✅ Keep Free tier valuable (so patients don't need to pay to use)
- ✅ Physician champions promote app during visits

**Contingency:** Even if patient adoption is low (30-40% vs 50% target), physician side (AI scribe) still delivers ROI.

### Risk #3: ROI Lower Than Expected

**Risk:** Time savings don't materialize, savings overestimated.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Conservative projections (50% time savings, not 75%)
- ✅ Pilot first (validate assumptions before full rollout)
- ✅ Track metrics religiously (time saved, satisfaction)

**Contingency:** Even in conservative scenario (25% time savings), ROI is still positive. If ROI truly doesn't materialize, can cancel after pilot (low commitment risk).

### Risk #4: Technical Issues (EHR Integration)

**Risk:** EHR integration fails, workflow disrupted.

**Mitigation:**
- ✅ Start with manual workflow (copy-paste SOAP notes into EHR) — works even without API
- ✅ Test integrations thoroughly during pilot
- ✅ Healthy4U support available for troubleshooting

**Contingency:** Manual workflow is slower but still saves time vs current state. Can improve integration over time.
