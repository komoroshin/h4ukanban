## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How is Healthy4U different from Freed.ai or Suki?**
A: Freed and Suki are scribe-only tools for physicians. Healthy4U adds an AI clinical consultant (analyzing full patient context) AND a patient-facing app (engagement between visits). It's the only platform that connects both sides.

**Q: What if our EHR doesn't have an API?**
A: We support manual workflows too. Physicians can copy-paste SOAP notes from Healthy4U into any EHR. Integration is nice-to-have, not required.

**Q: Do patients have to pay for the app?**
A: No! The Free tier is unlimited and free forever. Premium ($9.99/month) is optional for power users who want more AI queries and features.

**Q: What happens to patient data if we cancel?**
A: You get 30 days to export all data (JSON/CSV format). After 90 days, data is permanently deleted (except legal backups).

**Q: Can we try it with just 1 physician first?**
A: Yes! Start with a pilot (1-2 physicians) for 30-60 days. If it works, expand to the full practice.

**Q: Is there a long-term contract?**
A: Standard contract is 12 months, billed monthly (you can cancel with 30 days' notice, but no refunds on partial months). Early adopters get flexible terms.

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake in a SOAP note?**
A: Physicians MUST review all AI-generated content before using it. Healthy4U is a tool, not a replacement for clinical judgment. We're not liable for medical decisions—you are.

**Q: How long until we see ROI?**
A: Most clinics see positive ROI within 3-6 months. Payback is faster if you're eliminating existing costs (old scribe service, admin staff overtime, etc.).
