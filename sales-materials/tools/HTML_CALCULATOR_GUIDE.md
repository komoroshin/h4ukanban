### During "Use Cases & Quick Wins" Section (Slide 32-36)

**Step 1: Introduce the Calculator (1 min)**
- *"Let's calculate the exact ROI for YOUR practice. I'm going to use a live calculator here."*
- Show the calculator on screen

**Step 2: Gather Input from Clinic (2 min)**
Ask the room:
- *"How many physicians do you have?"* → Enter in "Number of Physicians"
- *"What's the average hourly rate?"* → Explain: Annual salary ÷ 2080 hours
  - If unsure, use $50 (typical primary care)
- *"How many hours/week do you spend on documentation?"* → Current state
- *"If AI scribe saves 50%, that's X hours saved."* → Enter half of current

**Step 3: Select Pricing (30 sec)**
- *"For early adopters like you, we offer Founder's Circle pricing at $174/month."*
- Select "Founder's Circle" from dropdown
- *"Implementation support is optional - we have free DIY or guided/full-service tiers."*
- Select appropriate tier (usually Tier 1 DIY for small practices)

**Step 4: Show Results in Real-Time (2 min)**
Results update automatically as you type. Highlight:
- 💰 **Monthly savings** - *"You're saving $X,XXX/month in physician time."*
- 💳 **Monthly cost** - *"Healthy4U costs $XXX/month for X physicians."*
- ✅ **Net savings** - *"Net savings: $X,XXX/month. That's real money back in your practice."*
- ⏱️ **Payback** - *"You recover your investment in X months."*

**Step 6: Show Competitor Comparison (1 min)**
Scroll to comparison table:
- *"Here's how Healthy4U compares to alternatives like Freed, Suki, DeepScribe."*
- Point out: *"Freed is cheaper but scribe-only. Healthy4U includes patient app for similar price."*
- *"Suki and DeepScribe are 2-3x more expensive without patient side."*

**Step 7: Offer to Print/Email (30 sec)**
- *"I can print this report for you right now."* → Cmd+P → Print or Save as PDF
- Or: *"I'll email you this exact calculator so you can play with numbers yourself."*

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Make It More Engaging
1. **Ask questions, don't lecture**
   - *"How many hours do YOU spend on notes?"* (not "typical doctors spend...")
   - Gets audience involved

2. **React to results**
   - *"Wow, that's $67K over 3 years! That's a new hire or upgraded equipment."*
   - Make ROI tangible

3. **Address skepticism immediately**
   - If someone says *"I don't think we'll save 4 hours"*
   - Type in 2 hours instead, show it's still positive ROI
   - *"Even at 2 hours/week, you're saving $X,XXX. Conservative estimate still works."*

4. **Show competitor comparison**
   - Don't skip this table
   - *"You could go with Freed at $99, but you lose patient app and AI consultant. Is saving $75/month worth losing those features?"*

### Troubleshooting

**Calculator doesn't open?**
- Try different browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Check if file is corrupted (re-download from repo)
- Right-click → Open With → Chrome

**Results look wrong?**
- Check inputs (did you enter hourly rate correctly?)
- Annual salary ÷ 2080 = hourly rate
- Example: $100K salary ÷ 2080 = $48/hour

**Need to edit the calculator?**
- Open `roi_calculator.html` in text editor (VS Code, Sublime)
- All logic is in `<script>` section at bottom
- CSS styling in `<style>` section at top
- Easy to customize colors, fonts, calculations
