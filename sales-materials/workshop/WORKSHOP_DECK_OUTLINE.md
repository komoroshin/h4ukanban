### Slide 12: ROI Benchmarks
**"What's the Business Case?"**
- Industry data table:

| Practice Size | Hours Saved/Week | Annual Value | Typical Investment | Payback |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Solo (1 physician) | 4-6 hours | $10K-15K | $2K-3K/year | 2-3 months |
| Small (3-5 physicians) | 12-25 hours | $30K-60K | $6K-12K/year | 2-4 months |
| Medium (10-20 physicians) | 40-100 hours | $100K-250K | $25K-50K/year | 3-6 months |

**"Most practices see positive ROI within 3-6 months"**

### Slide 13: What Works (and What Doesn't)
**"Lessons from Early Adopters"**

**✅ What Works:**
- Start with one use case (usually scribe) → expand
- Pilot with 1-2 physicians first
- Integrate with existing EHR (don't replace)
- Train staff properly (not just "figure it out")

**❌ What Doesn't Work:**
- Trying to replace humans entirely
- Big-bang rollouts (all physicians, day 1)
- Ignoring change management (staff resistance)
- "Set it and forget it" (needs ongoing optimization)
