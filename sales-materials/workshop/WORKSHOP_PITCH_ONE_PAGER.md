## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this a sales pitch for your platform?**
A: No. The workshop is vendor-agnostic education. We'll show you options from Freed, Suki, DeepScribe, and others. If our platform (Healthy4U) happens to fit your needs, we'll mention it in the audit phase—but only if it makes sense for you.

**Q: What if we decide AI isn't for us after the workshop?**
A: You'll still get immense value: understanding of the AI landscape, assessment of your practice, and a clear decision on whether to wait. No hard feelings.

**Q: Can we bring our entire staff?**
A: We recommend 3-7 key decision-makers for best interaction. If you want to train more staff later, that's a separate engagement.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**
A: Workshop fee is $1,500 upfront (or $1,000 early bird). If you proceed to implementation consulting later, we offer milestone-based payments.

**Q: What's the catch with the free audit?**
A: No catch. It's a loss leader for us—we invest time upfront to build trust. About 60-70% of clinics who complete the audit end up working with us (either using our platform or hiring us for implementation). But even if you don't, you'll have a valuable roadmap.

**Q: Is this only for US clinics?**
A: We work primarily in Israel and can consult for US clinics remotely. For US HIPAA compliance, we have BAA templates ready.
